  "bio": [
    "I specialize in statistical signal processing methods for structural characterization of pathological inclusions in Alzheimer's disease research. My primary focus areas include machine learning, inverse problems, multimodal imaging, and structural biology. I'm passionate about leveraging these techniques to advance our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.",
    "I received my Ph.D. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Northeastern University in December 2024. My research spans statistical signal processing, machine learning, inverse problems, multimodal imaging, and structural biology. I'm currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Makowski Laboratory at Northeastern University.",
    "Along my academic journey, I've been fortunate to contribute to multiple publications and collaborate with leading researchers in the field. Beyond my professional pursuits, I enjoy exploring new methodologies and developing innovative computational tools for biomedical research."
