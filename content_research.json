        "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of pathological protein aggregates, including amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles. Understanding the structural properties of these inclusions is crucial for developing effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",
        "Our research focuses on developing advanced statistical signal processing methods to characterize the structural properties of these pathological inclusions in human brain tissue. We leverage X-ray scattering techniques combined with novel computational approaches to extract detailed structural information at the nanoscale level.",
        "This work aims to provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and support the development of structure-based biomarkers for early disease detection."
